# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is an archive of the generative AI developments in higher education that I have come across. The main aim of this archive is to create a structured overview of developments, policies and studies on implementing and regulating AI in higher education. 

No parts of this resource have been generated with AI. All parts of this resource may be used and shared freely, also within AI tools, with the exception of model training. Do not use this resource for further training of generative AI models.

Feel free to contribute.

All the best,

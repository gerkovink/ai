    "text": "2.1 Machine learning basics\nMachine learning enables computers to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with varying levels of human intervention. For understanding this chapter, it is important to realize that some machine learning methods require quite strict human intervention or data pre-processing, while other methods can operate unsupervised and without stringent data pre-processing.\nIt is also important to understand that machine learning methods often work by means of training. An algorithm is trained to perform a single task or set of tasks. For example, a machine learning model can be trained on thousands of images to differentiate between photos of children or adults. Much like our own brain would learn to differentiate between such images.\nThe domain of machine learning that focuses on such human brain-like deep learning strategies is called neural networks (NNs). NNs consist of layers of units (so called neurons) that process input data. NNs are not specifically programmed to perform tasks, yet NNs process data in such a way that they autonomously learn to perform those tasks.",

    "section": "2.2 Transformers",
    "text": "2.2 Transformers\nTransformers (Vaswani et al. 2017) are a type of neural network that have advanced deep learning, particularly in the domain of natural language processing. Instead of modeling words one after another, transformers can look at whole sentences or paragraphs at once and take the context of text into account. It is not hard to imagine that contextual understanding allows for better learning and more flexible applications.\nGenerative AI tools, such as Gemini, chatGPT or GitHub Copilot are applications of transformers. These tools have been trained on extremely large amounts of data (mostly text) and have learned from the structure, meaning and nuances of the language. After training, these tools can generate new text that both coherent an contextually relevant. All this generation is based on the patterns the transformers learned during training.\nThere is a bit more nuance to the above two paragraph than I would initially have you believe. First, there are two mechanisms crucial in a transformer’s ability to understand the nuance and context of language: attention and self-attention. In a nutshell, these mechanisms allow the transformer to weigh the importance of words in the context, which creates a measure of the immediate and broader relations of each word. Second, the training step is far more complex than described above. There is a lot of fine-tuning involved. Additionally, for different purposes like programming code generation or visual image recognition, models must undergo additional training or finetuning with specific data sets. This makes the training of contemporary AI tools a time-consuming and human-curated task.\nContemporary AI tools can do much more than predict the next most likely word based on a given prompt or initial input. Modern AI tools can interpret images, read and solve mathematical formulae, start up virtual machines to autonomously evaluate self-generated computer code, and much more. Given the relatively recent introduction of transformers, this seamless integration of applications, skills and tasks is an impressive development.\n\n\n\n\nVaswani, Ashish, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan N Gomez, Łukasz Kaiser, and Illia Polosukhin. 2017. “Attention Is All You Need.” Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 30.",

    "text": "4.1 Embedding genAI in any project\nThe following policy suggestion ensures that generative AI is implemented in an academic setting by means of human moderation. It places the user in control of responsible interaction with the AI tool and warrants conscientious further implementation of the output generated by the AI tool. Following these suggestions minimizes the opportunity for unethical and unfair use of AI tools in academia.\nSuggestion 1: Minimize the use of AI tools as they are (currently) environmentally unfriendly\nMany users are unaware of the impact that contemporary AI tools may have on the environment. Together with e.g. cloud storage and e-mail traffic, AI tools constitute a hidden carbon footprint that often escapes our awareness. While it is not as apparent as airline travel, the impact of using AI tools may be far greater than you think (REFS?). While the environmental impact may be significantly lowered by on-chip generative AI , there will allways be a cost of using AI tools. Many people have thought about how AI will impact human life and Hollywood has monetized its threat to human existence. Not many may have realized that our lives may be at risk through AI-induced global warming.\nSuggestion 2. Don’t input confidential or personal information\nThis may seem intuitive, but the ability of AI tools to mimic human-like interaction may lull the user into the situation of disclosing more information than allowed. It is not hard to imagine a scenario where a well-engineered prompt would allow for the identification of the person who interacts with the AI tool, or worse - other people that are not aware of their personal ideas or identifying information being disclosed. While the AI tool itself seems anonymous and may not be sentient, any user should be aware of potential information or attribute disclosure.\nSuggestion 3. Don’t input information that violates IP or copyright\nWhen interacting with AI tools, users should protect intellectual property rights and copyright. When submitting prompts to AI tools it is paramount to ensure that\nSuggestion 4. Don’t violate IP with using output from the tool\nLikewise, it is paramount to realize that no intellectual property or copyright may be infringed with using the output of the AI tool. The training of the AI tool happened on a large set of data; some of that data may have been used illegitimately. By using AI generated output you may plagiarize existing work or otherwise infringe on intellectual property rights.\nThis is a tricky scenario, as the nontransparent training of AI tools makes it challenging to prove that no IP is infringed with the realized output. Given that the other suggestions are not violated, however, one could argue that embedding AI tools in a normal scientific knowledge discovery scenario would minimize the change of any infringement. Such a route would result in a process where information from multiple sources is processed and curated by an actual human.\nSuggestion 5. Confirm the output accuracy\nNever put your eggs in one basket. AI tools have demonstrated to yield inaccurate, incomplete or false information (REFS?). Always use multiple sources to verify any source of information and accept that you are responsible for using, interpreting and curating AI-generated output.\nSuggestion 6. Check the tool output for bias\nAI tools may produce output that may impact real humans and their rights, identifications, characteristics or status. Be careful not to input promts that are likely to generate biased output and do not use AI-generated output if potential bias may occur.\nSuggestion 7.. Don’t do bad or illegal things with AI tools\nNever use AI tools for illegal purposes or malicious intent, such as creating viruses, hacking networks or any form of computer crime or other crime.\nSuggestion 8:. Disclose the use of AI tools in your work Always disclose the use of AI tools, also when the work you generated is derived from AI-generated output. Always be transparent about your work.\nSuggestion 9:. Ask the tool not to use input for training This is a safety precaution that prevents further training of the models from input data.\nSuggestion 10:. Open the content you produce by using AI tools as much as possible with permissive licenses\nOpening up your research is a good practice in general.",

This is an repository holding resource for the generative AI developments in higher education that I have come across. The main aim of this resource is to create a structured overview of developments, policies and studies on implementing and regulating AI in higher education. The complete resource can be viewed as an online book at [www.gerkovink.com/ai](https://www.gerkovink.com/ai).

No parts of this repository have been generated with AI, with the exception of the following fun image of an ai that is surprised by the efficiency of humans [source](/img/dall-e_generation.png).

All the best,

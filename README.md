This is an archive of the generative AI developments in higher education that I have come across. The main aim of this archive is to create a structured overview of developments, policies and studies on implementing and regulating AI in higher education. The complete archive can be viewed as an online resource at [www.gerkovink.com/ai](https://www.gerkovink.com/ai).

No parts of this resource have been generated with AI, with the exception of the following fun [image of an ai that is surprised by the efficiency of humans](/img/dall-e_generation.png).
